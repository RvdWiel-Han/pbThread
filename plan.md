# TODO's

## General outline
A bot that interacts with 2 channels: submissions and scoreboard. The second is a channel in which the bot will automagically update either an embed (would need to learn how to do that, but would be fancy) or message with the current pb's if there's any updates. For updates there's the submissions channel, here one posts a screenshot and the boss + time as text. If enough people checkmark the post the highscore will be added to the list. Mods can interact with the bot in any channel they give it access to using / commands to either remove highscores or add categories.

## requested features
honestly people should learn git and create issues, but here's a list anyway:
- it's empty
- joke's on you
- I don't have people looking at this shit
